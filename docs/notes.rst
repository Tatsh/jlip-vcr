JLIP research
-------------

These commands are not guaranteed to work on anything other than the HR-S9600U and similar model
VCRs. Not responsible if any one of these fries your devices.

Most of the unknown codes were discovered by examining the raw data in the JVC Video Player binary.
The unknown codes below may be for other hardware like video editing equipment.

These commands are tested against HR-S9600U and HR-S9900U. Return values are from or pertain to
those devices.
